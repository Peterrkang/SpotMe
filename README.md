# SpotMe

**Work In Progress



An app that connects people who are trying to do an activity but need someone to spot them.
Users are able to create events which connect other users through conversation. Events are suppose to last only for 6-12 hrs Max. After those hours all conversation/events disappear. This would help build a community around a certain activity, instead of meeting only one person over and over.
